## Traditional Compliance Management vs Automated Platforms

| Aspect                | Traditional Method                                          | Automated Platforms (e.g., Vanta, Drata, Sprinto)        |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Approach**          | Manual, document-heavy, spreadsheet-based processes         | Automated evidence collection and continuous monitoring   |
| **Speed**             | Slow — audits and checks are done periodically              | Real-time compliance tracking and instant updates         |
| **Accuracy**          | Higher risk of human error and outdated documentation       | Automated checks reduce errors and keep controls current  |
| **Scalability**       | Difficult to scale; relies heavily on staff and consultants | Easily scales with infrastructure and new frameworks      |
| **Cost**              | High long-term cost due to manual labor and consulting      | Higher initial cost but lower ongoing maintenance cost    |
| **Visibility**        | Limited visibility into current compliance status           | Dashboards and reports offer full, real-time visibility   |
| **Audit Readiness**   | Reactive — evidence gathered when audit approaches          | Proactive — audit-ready at any time                       |
| **AI / Intelligence** | None                                                        | AI for remediation guidance or control mapping            |

Traditional compliance management relies heavily on manual processes, human interpretation, and static documentation.  
This makes it **time-consuming, error-prone, and hard to scale**, especially for cloud-based environments where configurations change rapidly.

### Value Proposition

While tools like **Vanta, Drata, and Sprinto automate the "doing" of compliance**, **CertiBot automates the "understanding"**.  
It interprets standards, explains implementation, and helps users act correctly.
CertiBot also extracts standards. Other tools do not provide this capability.

CertiBot combines:

- **Natural language interaction** — a chatbot interface where users can ask compliance-related questions;
- **AI reasoning** — automatic extraction and mapping of obligations from standards (ISO, SOC 2, NIS2, etc.);
- **Guidance** — context-aware explanations and examples for implementing specific controls.

# 4. Architecture

We have chosen a microservices architecture where each component is structured in layers with a shared database.

This design ensures that each service is a stand-alone product, capable of operating independently as well as integrating into the system's main pipeline.

Using this approach, we can achieve service independence, reusability of the services, and simplified data management.
