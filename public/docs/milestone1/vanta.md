## Comparison with CertiBot

While Vanta focuses on **automating compliance execution and monitoring**, CertiBot would address an **earlier and more interpretative stage** of the compliance lifecycle.

- Vanta streamlines operational compliance by **connecting directly to systems**, collecting evidence, monitoring controls, and providing dashboards to maintain audit readiness.

- CertiBot, in contrast, would specialize in **automating the interpretation of standards and regulations**, **extracting specific obligations** and **mapping them to corresponding controls or policies** **through a chat-bot**.

## How it uses AI

Vanta offers a chatbot feature known as the **Vanta AI Agent**.  
The core chatbot function, referred to as the **"policy chatbot"** provides instant answers to user questions regarding their specific organizational policies and overall policy management (e.g., "Is my Risk Management Policy audit ready?")  


Vanta AI Agent leverages AI to:
- **Questionnaire Automation**: It automatically generates accurate, well-cited responses for inbound security questionnaires.
- **Smarter Policy Management**: It automates policy onboarding (extracting key details and suggesting control mappings), summarizes policy changes for annual reviews, and identifies and flags inconsistencies between written policies and real-world practices.
- **Evidence Verification**: It performs real-time evidence evaluation, checking each piece of evidence against audit requirements to ensure it is accurate and complete.
