## Comparison with CertiBot

- Drata automates the **execution and monitoring** of compliance once controls and frameworks are defined;

- Drata **maintains and proves compliance**, while CertiBot **defines what compliance requires**;

## How it uses AI

Drata **does not have a dedicated chatbot feature** for automated compliance tasks.
