### Certification Process

Sprinto simplifies the path to certification through a three-step process — Assess, Activate, and Attest — enabling organizations to move from readiness to audit completion seamlessly.

1. **Assess** — Integrated Risk Assessment  
   Sprinto connects with cloud environment to map controls, scope out gaps, and implement measures that minimize them.

2. **Activate** — Continuous Monitoring and Evidence Collection  
   The platform continuously monitors controls against selected compliance frameworks, identifying misconfigurations and security lapses. Sprinto automatically captures compliance evidence in an audit-ready format.

3. **Attest** — Streamlined, Contactless Audits  
   Once controls are verified, Sprinto enables a smooth audit experience by connecting users with accredited auditors from its partner network—or allowing them to onboard their own. Evidence is shared securely and instantly through the platform, eliminating manual coordination and ensuring a faster certification process.
