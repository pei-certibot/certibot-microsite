                        CertiBot is an intelligent assistant designed to simplify and automate the complex process of regulatory compliance.  
                        Using AI and natural language processing, it extracts controls, requirements, and obligations directly from standards such as ISO, GDPR, and NIS2, transforming them into a structured, searchable knowledge base.  
                        Through an interactive chat interface, CertiBot guides users step by step during the implementation of controls, providing contextual explanations, best practices, and tailored recommendations for each clause.
                        <br /><br />
                        Beyond implementation, CertiBot also supports verification and auditing activities.  
                        It also helps organizations assess their current compliance status with accuracy and transparency.  
                        The integrated dashboards present real-time metrics, maturity scores, and coverage indicators, allowing teams to monitor progress and identify gaps that need attention.  
                        <br /><br />
                        With CertiBot, compliance becomes continuous and data-driven â€” reducing manual effort, minimizing interpretation errors, and ensuring that every decision is backed by verifiable information.
